# ExteriorVision-Deep_Convolutional_GAN_for_home_design_generation
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have gained significant popularity in the field of computer vision and image generation. ExteriorVision uses a DCGAN architecture to generate home design images based on a dataset of real-world house images.  

## Dataset used -

   Sample images from the dataset are -

## Visualizing Training Progress - 
  The training progress of ExteriorVision's DCGAN model can be tracked epoch by epoch. I have implemented GPU acceleration using Kaggle's GPU infrastructure, allowing you to visualize the generated home design images throughout the training process.  
    


## Future Enhancement -  

In the future, I aspire to enhance the project by focusing on elevating the quality of generated images. At present, my GPU resources pose constraints, but I have a vision to significantly boost the output image resolution, infusing it with greater realism, as I acquire access to more potent hardware.
